KosmoJS's React generator maintains continuous observation of your `pages`
directory, detecting new components and transforming them into route
configurations automatically.

Component creation triggers analysis of its filesystem location, generating
corresponding route configuration written to your `lib` directory for router
import.

Consider a component at `pages/users/[id]/index.tsx` - the generator produces
this configuration:

```ts
  {
    path: "users/:id",
    Component: lazy(() => import("@admin/pages/users/[id]")),
    loader: async ({ params }) => {
      const module = await import("@admin/pages/users/[id]") as ComponentModule;
      if (module.loader) {
        return module.loader({ params });
      }
      return null;
    },
  }
```

Several characteristics merit attention in this generated structure.

The generator performs automatic parameter syntax transformation, converting
filesystem bracket notation (`[id]`) into React Router's colon-prefix format
(`:id`).

Component implementation leverages lazy loading, excluding route code from
initial JavaScript bundles. Each route's code fetches on-demand when users
navigate to that specific path.

This universal lazy-loading approach yields significantly reduced initial
payloads, accelerating application startup. Visitors download code selectively
according to navigation patterns rather than receiving the complete
application upfront.

While eager loading might benefit high-priority routes, implementation would
require sophisticated AST parsing to detect configuration markers within
components. Since component imports would defeat lazy loading's purpose, the
generator maintains consistent lazy loading across all routes.

Route definitions incorporate loader functions automatically. When page
components export `loader` functions, the router executes them at strategic
moments: initial page load, link hover events, or navigation initiation.

This proactive data retrieval enhances user experience by acquiring necessary
information before component rendering, creating more responsive application
behavior.
