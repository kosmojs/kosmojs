`React` source folders default to client-side rendering with
Vite's development server and hot module replacement.

Adding the SSR generator introduces production-ready server rendering while preserving your familiar
development experience.

## 🎯 Client-Side Rendering by Default

Source folder initialization creates an `entry/client.tsx` file that manages
client-side rendering:

```tsx [entry/client.tsx]
import { hydrateRoot, createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import { routes, shouldHydrate } from "@src/{react}/client";
import App from "../App";
import createRouter from "../router";

const root = document.getElementById("app");

if (root) {
  const router = await createRouter(App, routes);
  if (shouldHydrate) {
    hydrateRoot(root, router);
  } else {
    createRoot(root).render(router);
  }
} else {
  console.error("Root element not found!");
}
```

The `shouldHydrate` flag determines the rendering approach. During
development, it's `false` and the application renders with `createRoot`. In
production SSR builds, it becomes `true` and `hydrateRoot` attaches
interactivity to server-generated markup.

This default configuration integrates seamlessly with Vite's development
server, delivering instant hot module replacement and the complete modern
development experience.

## 🛠️ Adding SSR Support

Install the SSR generator package:

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm install -D @kosmojs/ssr-generator
```

```sh [npm]
npm install -D @kosmojs/ssr-generator
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn add -D @kosmojs/ssr-generator
```
:::

Register the generator in your source folder's `vite.config.ts`:

```ts [vite.config.ts]
import reactPlugin from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import devPlugin from "@kosmojs/dev";
import reactGenerator from "@kosmojs/react-generator";
import ssrGenerator from "@kosmojs/ssr-generator";
import defineConfig from "../vite.base";

export default defineConfig(import.meta.dirname, {
  plugins: [
    reactPlugin(),
    devPlugin(apiurl, {
      generators: [
        reactGenerator(),
        ssrGenerator(), // Add SSR generator
        // other generators...
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## 📄 Server Entry Implementation

The SSR generator creates `entry/server.ts` with a default server rendering implementation:

```ts [entry/server.ts]
import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
import { routes } from "@src/{react}/server";
import App from "../App";
import createRouter from "../router";

export default {
  async factory(url) {
    const router = await createRouter(App, routes, { url });
    return {
      renderToString({ criticalCss }) {
        const head = criticalCss
          .map(({ text }) => `<style>${text}</style>`)
          .join("\n");
        const html = renderToString(router);
        return { head, html };
      },
    };
  },
} satisfies import("@kosmojs/dev").SSRSetup;
```

The `factory` function receives the requested URL and returns an object
with `renderToString`, `renderToStream`, or both.

When both are present, `renderToStream` takes precedence.

### Static Asset Handling

By default, the SSR server loads client assets into memory at startup and serves them on request.

You can also export `serveStaticAssets` to control this behavior:

```ts [entry/server.ts]
export default {
  serveStaticAssets: false,
  async factory(url) {
    // ...
  },
} satisfies import("@kosmojs/dev").SSRSetup;
```

When set to `false`, static assets won't be loaded and requests for them will return `404 Not Found`.

This is recommended when running behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx) that handles static file serving.

## 🎛️ Render Factory Arguments

Both `renderToString` and `renderToStream` receive the same argument object:

```ts
type SSROptions = {
  template: string;
  manifest: Record<string, SSRManifestEntry>;
  criticalCss: Array<{ text: string; url: string }>;
  request: IncomingMessage;
  response: ServerResponse;
};
```

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `template` | The original client `index.html` from `Vite` build, containing `<!--app-head-->` and `<!--app-html-->` placeholders for SSR content injection |
| `manifest` | Vite's `manifest.json` - the full dependency graph for client modules, dynamic imports, and related CSS |
| `criticalCss` | Route-specific CSS chunks resolved from the manifest graph |
| `request` | Node.js `IncomingMessage` for inspecting headers, cookies, locale, etc. |
| `response` | Node.js `ServerResponse` for setting headers, caching, redirects, or flushing streamed HTML |

### Critical CSS Usage

Each `criticalCss` entry provides both the asset URL and the decoded content:

- `url` - browser-loadable asset path
- `text` - decoded CSS content

This gives you flexibility in how styles are delivered:

| Strategy | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| `<style>${text}</style>` | Fastest first paint - no extra requests |
| `<link rel="stylesheet" href="${url}">` | Better cache reuse across pages |
| `<link rel="preload" as="style" href="${url}">` | Warm loading for deferred styles |

### Request/Response Access

The raw `request` and `response` objects enable advanced SSR control:

- Inspect headers (User-Agent, cookies, locale)
- Set custom response headers (caching, redirects)
- Flush HTML progressively in streaming mode

This allows renderers to choose between high-level HTML return (`renderToString`) or low-level streaming control (`renderToStream`).

## 🔤 String-Based Rendering

The `renderToString` approach offers simplicity and works well for most SSR scenarios:

```ts
renderToString(SSROptions): SSRStringReturn
```

It receives `SSROptions` as first argument and returns a `SSRStringReturn` object:

```ts
type SSRStringReturn = {
  head?: string;  // Optional <head> content (scripts, meta, styles)
  html: string;   // Complete rendered application markup
};
```

The `head` property is optional, but including the provided `criticalCss` is recommended
to avoid render-blocking stylesheets and improve first paint performance.

The default implementation leverages React Router's static handler to prepare routing context,
then uses React's `renderToString` to generate the complete HTML in a single pass.

## 🌊 Stream Rendering

For advanced use cases requiring progressive HTML delivery, implement the `renderToStream` method.

It receives `SSROptions` as well and supposed to implement app-specific streaming strategy.

A typical streaming pattern divides the template and progressively writes chunks:

```ts [entry/server.ts]
import { renderToPipeableStream } from "react-dom/server";

import { routes } from "@src/{react}/server";
import App from "../App";
import createRouter from "../router";

export default {
  async factory(url) {
    const router = await createRouter(App, routes, { url });
    return {
      renderToStream({ response, template, criticalCss }) {
        const head = criticalCss
          .map(({ text }) => `<style>${text}</style>`)
          .join("\n");

        // Divide template at application insertion point
        const [htmlStart, htmlEnd] = template.split("<!--app-html-->");

        // Send initial HTML with head content
        response.write(htmlStart.replace("<!--app-head-->", head));

        // Create pipeable stream
        const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(
          router,
          {
            onShellReady() {
              // Stream application HTML
              pipe(response);
            },
            onShellError(error) {
              console.error("Shell error:", error);
              response.statusCode = 500;
              response.end();
            },
            onAllReady() {
              // Append closing HTML
              response.write(htmlEnd);
              response.end(); // Essential: Close the response
            },
          }
        );
      },
    };
  },
} satisfies import("@kosmojs/dev").SSRSetup;
```

**Essential:** Always invoke `response.end()` after streaming completes.
Omitting this call leaves clients waiting indefinitely for additional data.

React's `renderToPipeableStream` provides sophisticated streaming with
suspense boundary support, but implementation details remain your choice
based on application requirements.

## 🏗️ Production Build Process

Generate your SSR bundle using the standard build command:

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm build
```

```sh [npm]
npm run build
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn build
```
:::

This produces an SSR-ready bundle at `dist/SOURCE_FOLDER/ssr/` containing
`index.js` for production execution.

## 🧪 Local Testing Before Deployment

Test your SSR bundle locally before production deployment. The server
accepts port or socket configuration:

**Port-based execution:**

```sh
node dist/@front/ssr -p 4000
# or
node dist/@front/ssr --port 4000
```

**Socket-based execution:**

```sh
node dist/@front/ssr -s /tmp/app.sock
# or
node dist/@front/ssr --sock /tmp/app.sock
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to verify proper server-side rendering.

## 🚀 Production Infrastructure

Deploy the SSR bundle behind a reverse proxy like nginx or Caddy.
Example nginx configuration:

```nginx
upstream react_ssr {
  server 127.0.0.1:4000;
  # or socket-based:
  # server unix:/tmp/app.sock;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name myapp.com;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://react_ssr;
  }
}
```

This configuration properly forwards requests while maintaining appropriate
headers and connection upgrades.

## 🔄 Unchanged Development Experience

The SSR generator preserves your development workflow. During development:

- Execute `pnpm dev` normally
- `Vite` handles all requests with hot module replacement (HMR)
- Client-side rendering provides immediate feedback
- Complete development experience remains intact

Server-side rendering activates exclusively in production builds, delivering
optimal development velocity alongside production-ready server rendering.

## 💡 Production Guidelines

**Validate locally before deploying.** Always test your production bundle
locally, verifying correct rendering before deploying to live servers.

**Implement streaming for content-heavy pages.** Applications generating
substantial HTML or executing complex data operations benefit from
`renderToStream`. Progressive rendering improves perceived performance as
content arrives incrementally.

**Monitor process resources.** SSR maintains persistent Node.js processes.
Track memory consumption and implement robust error handling to prevent
resource leaks.

**Deploy caching strategically.** Position a CDN or cache layer before your
SSR server for infrequently changing routes. This reduces server load and
accelerates response delivery.

**Implement comprehensive error handling.** Add error boundaries throughout
your application and proper error handling in server entry points. Server
errors shouldn't terminate entire processes.

**Leverage multiple source folders instead of hybrid rendering.** Avoid
complex route-level SSR/CSR switching logic within a single source folder.
Instead, utilize `KosmoJS`'s architectural strength: create separate source
folders for different purposes. Deploy SSR for your marketing folder to
maximize SEO performance, while maintaining CSR in your customer application
folder for optimal interactivity. This separation delivers cleaner codebases,
straightforward maintenance, and embodies `KosmoJS`'s core principle - each
application concern occupies its own domain with the most suitable rendering
approach.

## ⚠️ Technical Considerations

**Browser-specific APIs unavailable.** Code executing during SSR cannot
access `window`, `document`, or browser-exclusive APIs. Use conditional
checks or lifecycle methods that execute client-side only.

**Coordinate asynchronous data loading.** React's Suspense works in SSR
contexts, but ensure data fetching completes before rendering. The framework
handles most cases, though complex async patterns require careful attention.

**Bundle optimization remains important.** In SSR, initial bundle size
affects server memory and process startup time rather than user download
duration. However, the hydration bundle downloads to clients, making
optimization crucial.

**Plan state serialization carefully.** Applications with complex state
require proper serialization for hydration. `React` handles standard cases
automatically, but custom state management or non-serializable data needs
special handling.
